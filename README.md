# blogSpace

This is a project made for studying purposes, here I'm praticing working with an API, loading templates of blog posts from the api by a GET request and then adding a new post by a POST request. 
The CSS here is just basic, but I try to make it looks good.
In JavaScript I had the oportunity to work with a for... of syntax and work my way out to render elements in the DOM.
